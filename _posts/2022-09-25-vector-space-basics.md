If you wander in the world of quantum computing(QC) long enough, it becomes painful to follow the arguments of quantum algorithms with your vague and shaky knowledge base of linear algebra. Inspired by this, the author takes an initiative to write a series of notes on linear algebra before we undertake the endeavor of QC rigorously. By writing the notes with QC in mind, the author hopes to emphasize the key parts of linear algebra that will repeatedly be used in QC applications.<!--more-->

The objectives of this note are:
- Introduce the concepts of vector space, subspace, (direct) sum of subspaces
- Some nice proof exercises for knowledge testing
