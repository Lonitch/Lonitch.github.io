## TL;DR

This blog introduces the quantum theory of free electromagnetic field, a sequel to my QM in Hilbert space blog.

## Motivation/Birdview

Needless to say, the Maxwell's equation set for electromagnetism is one of the most fundamental pillars that underspins so many branches of mordern physics. CERN has proven experimentally that Maxwell is right even at quantum-scale. However, we cannot apply classical Maxwell's equation in quantum field theory. Instead, we need to quantize the classical electromagnetic field in order to use the Hilbert-space formalism we developed in the part I. I should also admit that the quantization of electromagnetic fields could become nasty once we also take into account the interactions between different fields. Therefore, let us do one thing at a time and quantize the free electromagnetic field (free EM field) here.

We will start with the derivation of classical Hamiltonian of a free charge in a free electromagnetic field. We will then prove that the Hamiltonian gives classical equation of motions for the free charge using Hamiltonian equations. The **gauge invariance** will briefly be discussed along the way. When we are comfortable with the classical Hamiltonian, we can quantize the classical terms into operators to get quantum Hamiltonian. By solving the Schrodinger equation with the quantized Hamiltonian, we can show that the **gauge transformation** causes a phase change in the eigenfunctions/wavefunctions. With the quantization of free EM field ready, we will see how the quantized EM field and Hilbert-space formalism could dance together with one caveat: the vanishing expectation value of the electric field operator $\het{\mathbf{E}}$. We will solve this problem in the last part of this blog by using the **coherent states** as the eigenstates to the free EM field. It turns out that the coherent state is also a convenient tool to solve simple problems related to the polaron theory.
