## Me as an OATHBREAKER
I said in my previous post that my love for the students was fading and that it would be my last note on heat transfer lab. Well, somehow my passion for "accessible" part of physics sustained and I decided to make notes for all the labs that I tought throughout last 3 years as a lab TA. The finalized manuscript is attached below. The source Latex code is also available on github [here](https://github.com/Lonitch/HeatTransferLabNote). For those who want to learn some heat transfer from a different perspective, I hope you find this volume a joyful read.
