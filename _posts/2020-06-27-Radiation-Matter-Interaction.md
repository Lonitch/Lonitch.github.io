## Motivation

While working on my side project of *ab initio* polaron theory, I realize that none of my notes is explicitly related to the radiation-matter interaction (RMI). It's a bit weird at this point that RMI never occur to me as an important thing to learn even though the polaron is a result of interactions between electrons and radiation-excited phonons in crystalline lattice. After a search for proper sources to learn RMI, I laid my eyes on Edward Harris' **A Pedestrian Approach to Quantum Field Theory**. For a guy who just finished Dr. Klauber's excellent **Student Friendly Quantum Field Theory**, I was kinda reluctant to start reading another introductory book on QFT with concerns of wasting too much time. But Edward's book turned out to be a huge page-turner after I scanned through the first chapter. This blog is dedicated to reproduce some of the important conclusions in the first three chapters of Edward's book. All the derivation in this blog is prepared for those who had an introductory non-relativistic quantum mechanics class, but a brief review of axioms of QM is also given somewhere along the derivation.
