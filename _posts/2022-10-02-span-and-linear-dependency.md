This note is based on Linear Done Right by Sheldon Axler, explaining some aspects that confuse me when reading Sec. 2.1 of the book. I personally don't own any credit for the proofs showing here. This is just a compilation of better ways(in my personal opinion) to present the content in the book. By following the same nomenclature in the book, we use $\mathcal{F}$ to represent either $\mabb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$.
