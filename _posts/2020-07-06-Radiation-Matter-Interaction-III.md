## TL;DR

This blog summarizes the quantized systems introduced in the previous two parts and uses them in the context of radiation-matter interaction.

## Bird's view
We will start with the derivation of the Hamiltonian for a system composed of EM field and free particles. The resulted Hamiltonian will be devided into three parts that describe particles' energy, EM field energy/radiation energy, and the interaction energy. We then use the Hamiltonian to discuss the examples of light emission from an excited atom, lifetime of excited states, adsorption of photons, photon scattering from free electrons, and some special topics.
