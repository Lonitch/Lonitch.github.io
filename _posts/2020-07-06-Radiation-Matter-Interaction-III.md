## TL;DR

This blog summarizes the quantized systems introduced in the previous two parts and uses them in the context of radiation-matter interaction.

## Bird's view
We will start with the derivation of the Hamiltonian for a system composed of EM field and free particles. The resulted Hamiltonian will be devided into three parts that describe particles' energy, EM field energy/radiation energy, and the interaction energy. We then use the Hamiltonian to discuss the examples of light emission from an excited atom, lifetime of excited states, adsorption of photons, photon scattering from free electrons, and some special topics.

## Hamiltonian of The EM Field+Paticles System
The system we are interested in here is composed of matters and EM fields, or photons. Usually we would like to think the matter is built up by particles with various masses $m_i$ and charges $e_i$. The interactions of these particles are always treated in a form of $V(\ldots,\mathbf{x}_i,\ldots)$. The Coulombic interaction is one example of such interaction,

$$V_{\text {Coulomb }}\left(\ldots, \boldsymbol{x}_{i}, \ldots, \boldsymbol{x}_{j}, \ldots\right)=\frac{1}{2} \sum_{i, j \atop i \neq j} \frac{e_{i} e_{j}}{\left|\boldsymbol{x}_{i}-\boldsymbol{x}_{j}\right|}\tag{1.1}.$$

Based on the discussions laid out in Part I and II, the Hamiltonian operator for our matter-radiation system can be written as

$$\begin{aligned}
\hat{H}=& \sum_{i} \frac{\left(\hat{\boldsymbol{p}}_{i}-\frac{e_{1}}{c} \hat{\boldsymbol{A}}\left(\boldsymbol{x}_{i}\right)\right)\left(\hat{\boldsymbol{p}}_{i}-\frac{\epsilon_{i}}{c} \hat{\boldsymbol{A}}\left(\boldsymbol{x}_{i}\right)\right)}{2 m_{i}}+V \\
&+\int \frac{\hat{\boldsymbol{E}} \cdot \hat{\boldsymbol{E}}^{*}+\hat{\boldsymbol{B}} \cdot \hat{\boldsymbol{B}}^{*}}{8 \pi} \mathrm{d}^{3} x \\
=& \hat{H}_{\mathrm{mp}}+\hat{H}_{\mathrm{rad}}+\hat{H}_{\mathrm{int}},
\end{aligned}\tag{1.2}$$

where

$$\hat{H}_{\mathrm{mp}}=\sum_{i} \frac{\hat{\boldsymbol{p}}_{i}^{2}}{2 m_{i}}+V\tag{1.3},$$

and the "mp" stands for "many particles".
