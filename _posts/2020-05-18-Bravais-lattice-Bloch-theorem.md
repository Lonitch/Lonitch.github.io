## Background

I've been reading stuff for quite some time, now it's the time to dive into some real-world problems. One of my current research interests is the many-body effects to conductivity properties of electroactive materials, like the electrode materials used in rechargeable battery and Faradaic desalination cell. More specifically, recent studies proved that the dynamics of polarons, a quasi-particle made of a bare electron dressed by its interactions with positive charges and phonons, could be used to explain variation of electronic conductivity in various materials[[1]](#1). To study many-body effects in periodic/aperiodic potential environment (i.e., crystal lattice), I will prepare blog articles to refresh and develop a solid understanding of condensed state physics first, then review related concepts/methods from quantum field theory (QFT), and finally hit the details of polaron dynamics.

As an outsider of physics research community, the goal of writing blogs is to make things crystal clear both mathematically and intuitively. Any comments and corrections are welcomed.
