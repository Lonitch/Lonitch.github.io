## Background

I've been reading stuff for quite some time, now it's the time to dive into some real-world problems. One of my current research interests is the many-body effects to conductivity properties of electrochemical systems, like rechargeable battery and Faradaic desalination cell. More specifically, recent studies proved that the dynamics of polarons, a quasi-particle made of a bare electron dressed by its interactions with positive charges and phonons, could be used to explain variation of electronic conductivity in various materials[[1]](#1). To study many-body effects in periodic/aperiodic environment, I need to refresh and develop a solid understanding of condensed state physics
