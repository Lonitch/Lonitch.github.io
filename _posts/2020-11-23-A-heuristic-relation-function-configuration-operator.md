## Transform handwriting notes in oneNote to multiple-page PDF

If you're like me who has long been irritated by the flawed PDF-exporting function in oneNote, and embarrased by lengthy one-page PDF file generated from your handwriting notes, now it's the time to work around these problems using the following method. For Windows users, the method transforms your trapped long notes into nicely formatted multiple-page PDF file. The method is made of two steps:

1. Go to one of your long handwriting note and print it using the option of "**Microsoft XPS document writer**"
2. You will see a ".xps" file is generated on your computer. Search "**XPS2PDF**" in your browser and use web app to transform ".xps" into ".pdf" file.

Note that if your notes are short enough to fit into one letter page, you're welcome to use "windows to PDF" option in the "print" menu and it will work like a charm. Now you can enjoy your newly-generated file and show off, my fellow control freak and neat-notes lovers.

## Talk about function and configurational space in a very simple example
I was inspired by M. El-Batanouny's [*Symmetry and Condensed Matter Physics*](https://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/physics/condensed-matter-physics-nanoscience-and-mesoscopic-physics/symmetry-and-condensed-matter-physics-computational-approach?format=HB&isbn=9780521828451), and realized that we can talk about the relationship between the transformation operators in function space and that in configurational space in a very intuitive way, by using an examplary function $f(x)=x^2$. The link to my notes can be find [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hfOFklYlB18lDph6DlkLhZKdcwsSR_Ho/view?usp=sharing). The notes entice amateurs to understand the importance of applying group theory in physical problems. A big takeaway from my notes is that the passive transformations/operators in configurational space have their counterparts in function space as active transformations/operators. I also added some simple operator algebra towards the end to show how can we move operators in function space to configurational space by reversing the effects of those operators.
