## Background

This is the first blog for the introduction to the polaron theory, a framework that promotes the understanding of lattice distortion and interstitials' diffusion. The contempratory energy storage materials have large interstitial space for ion intercalation. For example $Li_xFePO_4$ intercalates Li-ion during discharging process. The intercalation of ions is accompanied by the lattice ditortion and ion migration.
