## Understand reactivity

SolidJS uses:

- `createSignal`: Fine-grained signals that hold a value and represent that value overtime

- `createEffect`: All reactive variables(signals) are function calls, and might be wrapped in effect functions; the wrapping function reruns everytime reacitive variables change

- `createMemo`: Derived variables(Memos) are composed of signals, and are re-calculated when dependent signals change

- `untrack(fn)/batch(fn)`: prevent reactive tracking within the scope of `fn` function/ waits to apply changes until `fn` completes

### Ground TRUTH: reactive function reruns whenever its outcome changes

The example shows how a conditionally reactive function changes its outcome when signals it depends vary.

```typescript
const [firstName, setFirstName] = createSignal("John");
const [lastName, setLastName] = createSignal("Smith");
const [showFullName, setShowFullName] = createSignal(true);

const displayName = createMemo(() => {
  if (!showFullName()) return firstName();
  return `${firstName()} ${lastName()}`;
});

createEffect(() => log("My name is", displayName()));
// print: My name is John Smith
setLastName("Legend");
// print: My name is John Legend
setShowFullName(false);
// print: My name is John
setLastName("Lange");
// NOTHING!!! showFullName is false, "createEffect" results the same thing!
setShowFullName(true);
// print: My name is John Lange
}
```

## Build a Reactive System

### `createSignal` and `createEffect` from scratch

```javascript
// create a stack of observers subscribing the signal,
// last in first out
const context = [];

function subscribe(observer, subscriptions) {
  subscriptions.add(observer);
}

export function createSignal(value) {
  const subscriptions = new Set();

  const read = () => {
    // get the lastest observer
    const observer = context[context.length - 1];
    // if observer exists, then add it as this signal's
    // subscriber
    if (observer) subscribe(observer, subscriptions);

    return value;
  };
  const write = (newvalue) => {
    value = newvalue;
    // now that the signal value is updated,
    // all the subscribers of this signal
    // should be rerun
    // p.s. we clone subcriptions here to avoid
    // infinite loop(see next snippet)
    for (const observer of [...subscriptions]) {
      observer.execute();
    }
  };

  return [read, write];
}

export function createEffect(fn) {
  const effect = {
    // after the first execution,
    // notice this is always executed after "value=newvalue" in "write"
    execute() {
      // make this effect observer of the signal
      // so that "read" in "fn" can find this effect
      context.push(effect);
      // then run the function that wraps "read"
      fn();
      // pop this effect out of the stack
      context.pop();
    },
  };
  // the first execution when effect created.
  effect.execute();
}
```

The implementation of "`createSignal`" and "`createEffect`" above is not optimal, as it does not prevent repetivie executions that cause the same result. For example, if we have the following snippet:

```javascript
const [count, setCount] = createSignal(0);
const [count2, setCount2] = createSignal(2);
const [show, setShow] = createSignal(true);

createEffect(() => {
  if (show()) console.log("count1:", count());
  else console.log("count2", count2());
});
// print count1 0

setShow(false);
// print: count2 2
setCount(10);
// repetitive print: count2 2
// but we don't want this! In real-world application
// this repetitive behavior is the source of sluggish reactions!
```

"`count2 2`" is printed twice above. To fix this, we can create a "`cleanup`" function to make `effec` and `count` forget about each other when `setShow(false)`.

```javascript
// this function decouples signal and effect
function cleanup(observer) {
  for (const dep of observer.dependencies) {
    // make signals forget about the effect
    dep.delete(observer);
  }
  // make effect forget about the signals
  observer.dependencies.clear();
}

// we also rewrite "subscribe" here to make
// signal and effect are linked in BOTH ways
function subscribe(observer, subscriptions) {
  subscriptions.add(observer);
  observer.dependencies.add(subscriptions);
}
export function createEffect(fn) {
  const effect = {
    execute() {
      cleanup(effect);
      context.push(effect);
      fn();
      context.pop();
    },
    dependencies: new Set(),
  };

  effect.execute();
}
```

Now, "`count2 2`" is only logged once. What happened above can be briefly summarized as the following set of steps:

- "`createEffect`" first execution makes the effect and the signals, "`count`" and "`show`", linked in both ways, because of the calls, "`show()`" and "`count()`"
- "`setShow(false)`" cleans up the links above, but the calls, "`show()`" and "`count2()`", in the `fn` makes the effect now linked with "`count2`" and "`show`"
- when "`setCount(10)`" is executed, the effect is no longer linked to "`count`", and "[ ...subscriptions]" is empty, so nothing new is printed out

### Implement "`createMemo`" & "`untrack`"

"`createMemo`" is commonly used to create **derived signal** from signals created by "`createSignal`". Here we create a simplified version of "`createMemo`" of SolidJS. Notice how "`fn`", "`setSignal`", and "`createEffect`" are nested below:

```javascript
function createMemo(fn) {
  const [signal, setSignal] = createSignal();
  createEffect(() => setSignal(fn()));
  return signal;
}

setCount(0);
setCount2(2);
// derived signal "sum" is based on "count" and "count2"
const sum = createMemo(() => count() + count2());

// assuming you're using count and count2 from the previous lisings
createEffect(() => console.log(count(), count2(), sum()));
// print: 0,2,2

setCount(10);
//print two lines
// 10 2 12
// 10 2 12
// what happened under the hood:
// `subscriptions` in `setCount` has two members:
// the effect in `createMemo`, and the one at the end
// execute of the first `createEffect` calls `setSignal(fn())` with `fn()->12`
// because `signal` created by `createMemo` subscribes one effect(the one at the end)
// `observer.execute()` in the function `setSignal(fn())` results in the first
// "10 2 12" printed out
// coming back to the for loop in `setCount`, we are now iterating at the effect
// at the bottom. `observer.execute()` now results in the second "10 2 12" printed
```

We now implement the `untrack` function, which takes another function as its argument, and allow argument function to be run without triggering any dependent effect.

```javascript
function untrack(fn) {
  const preContext = context;
  // we first empty current context,
  // so the function execution does NOT
  // trigger any subscription
  context = [];
  // we then fun the function
  const res = fn();
  // reload the context
  context = preContext;
  // return the result
  return res;
}

// assuming you're using createSignal and createEffect from above
const [count, setCount] = createSignal(0);

createEffect(() => console.log(untrack(count)));
// print 0
setCount(10);
// print nothing, as "subscriptions" is empty in count signal.
```

## Rendering with Reactivity

The example in the previous section is essentially how SolidJS deals with reactivity. Lukily, SolidJS abstracts away the details of state management and effect trigger for us. In this section, let us use examples to show functionalities of SolidJS, and demisify its performance.

### Create component in SolidJS

In the following snippet, we create a simple counter component that increments by 1 per second, and also allows increments by clicking a button. Then rendered result can be checked [here](https://playground.solidjs.com/anonymous/67f946dc-897c-4094-a986-7ba6ee17cbcd)

```ts
import { createSignal} from "solid-js";
import { render } from "solid-js/web"

function Counter(){
    const [count, setCount] = createSignal(0);
    console.log("Counter");
    // print "Counter" only once, no matter
    // how many times you click the button

    return (
        <>
        {/*createEffect under the hood*/}
        <h1>{`the count is ${count()}`}</h1>
        {/* onClick is a createEffect under the hood */}
        <button onClick={()=>setCount(()=>count()+1)}>click</button>
        </>
    )
}

function App(){
    return <>
      {/*two counters have their own state mgmt*/}
      <Counter/>
      <Counter/>
    </>
}

render(App, document.body);
```

We can make the two counters sharing the same state as the following:

```javascript
import { createSignal } from "solid-js";
import { render } from "solid-js/web";

function Counter(props) {
  console.log("Counter");
  return (
    <>
      <h1>{`the count is ${props.children}`}</h1>
      <button onClick={props.onClick}>click</button>
    </>
  );
}

function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = createSignal(0);
  return (
    <>
      <Counter onClick={() => setCount(() => count() + 1)}>{count()}</Counter>
      <Counter onClick={() => setCount(() => count() + 2)}>
        {count() * 2}
      </Counter>
    </>
  );
}

render(App, document.body);
```

The rendered result can be found [here](https://playground.solidjs.com/anonymous/a9b63481-0947-40b6-a1ad-cb0d805290f1). Thus, the performance does NOT scale with number of components, or size of code, it scales on interactivity.

All rendering has an effect under the hood, so it does not matter how many components you have created, but the logic you want to implement with the signals. Like the "`props`" above is a good example of how we flatten the component logic by preparing properties with the signal "`count`".

As we will see in later sections, SolidJS deviates from other framework like Vue orReact in that rendering is tied to respond to data instead of rerendering full components whenever there is a change in data.

## Control Flow

SolidJS ships with components for flow control, the table below gives an overview of what they are:

| conditionals       | use                                                 |
| :----------------- | :-------------------------------------------------- |
| `<Show/>`          | display content when a condition is met             |
| `<Switch/>`        | multi-conditional logic (ie select/case, if/elseif) |
| `<Dynamic/>`       | swap rendered element or component                  |
| `<ErrorBoundary/>` | display when an error is uncaught                   |

| Loops      | use                                       |
| :--------- | :---------------------------------------- |
| `<For/>`   | loop automatically keyed by reference/key |
| `<Index/>` | loop automatically keyed by index         |
