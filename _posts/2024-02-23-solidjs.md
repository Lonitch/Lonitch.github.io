## Understand reactivity

SolidJS uses:

- `createSignal`: Fine-grained signals that hold a value and represent that value overtime

- `createEffect`: All reactive variables(signals) are function calls, and might be wrapped in effect functions; the wrapping function reruns everytime reacitive variables change

- `createMemo`: Derived variables(Memos) are composed of signals, and are re-calculated when dependent signals change

- `untrack(fn)/batch(fn)`: prevent reactive tracking within the scope of `fn` function/ waits to apply changes until `fn` completes

### Ground TRUTH: reactive function reruns whenever its outcome changes
The example shows how a conditionally reactive function changes its outcome when signals it depends vary.
```typescript 
const [firstName, setFirstName] = createSignal("John");
const [lastName, setLastName] = createSignal("Smith");
const [showFullName, setShowFullName] = createSignal(true);

const displayName = createMemo(() => {
  if (!showFullName()) return firstName();
  return `${firstName()} ${lastName()}`;
});

createEffect(() => log("My name is", displayName()));
// print: My name is John Smith
setLastName("Legend");
// print: My name is John Legend
setShowFullName(false);
// print: My name is John
setLastName("Lange");
// NOTHING!!! showFullName is false, "createEffect" results the same thing!
setShowFullName(true);
// print: My name is John Lange
}
```

## Build a Reactive System 
### `createSignal` and `createEffect` from scratch 
```javascript
// create a stack of observers subscribing the signal, 
// last in first out 
const context = [];

function subscribe(observer, subscriptions){
  subscriptions.add(observer);
}

export function createSignal(value){
    const subscriptions = new Set();

    const read = ()=> {
        // get the lastest observer
        const observer = context[context.length-1]
        // if observer exists, then add it as this signal's 
        // subscriber 
        if (observer) subscribe(observer,subscriptions);

        return value
    }
    const write = (newvalue) => { 
        value = newvalue; 
        // now that the signal value is updated,
        // all the subscribers of this signal 
        // should be rerun
        // p.s. we clone subcriptions here to avoid 
        // infinite loop(see next snippet)
        for (const observer of [ ...subscriptions ]) {
            observer.execute()
        }
    }

    return [read, write];
}

export function createEffect(fn){
    const effect = {
        // after the first execution,
        // notice this is always executed after "value=newvalue" in "write"
        execute(){
            // make this effect observer of the signal
            // so that "read" in "fn" can find this effect
            context.push(effect);
            // then run the function that wraps "read"
            fn();
            // pop this effect out of the stack 
            context.pop();

        }
    }
    // the first execution when effect created.
    effect.execute();
}
```

The implementation of "`createSignal`" and "`createEffect`" above is not optimal, as it does not prevent repetivie executions that cause the same result. For example, if we have the following snippet:

```javascript 
const [count, setCount] = createSignal(0);
const [count2, setCount2] = createSignal(2);
const [show, setShow] = createSignal(true);

createEffect(
  ()=>{
    if(show()) console.log('count1:',count())
    else console.log("count2",count2())
  }
)
// print count1 0

setShow(false);
// print: count2 2
setCount(10);
// repetitive print: count2 2
// but we don't want this! In real-world application 
// this repetitive behavior is the source of sluggish reactions!
```

"`count2 2`" is printed twice above. To fix this, we can create a "`cleanup`" function to make `effec` and `count` forget about each other when `setShow(false)`.

```javascript 
// this function decouples signal and effect
function cleanup(observer){
  for (const dep of observer.dependencies){
        // make signals forget about the effect
        dep.delete(observer)
    }
    // make effect forget about the signals
    observer.dependencies.clear()
}

// we also rewrite "subscribe" here to make 
// signal and effect are linked in BOTH ways
function subscribe(observer, subscriptions){
  subscriptions.add(observer);
  observer.dependencies.add(subscriptions);
}
export function createEffect(fn) {
    const effect = {
        execute(){
            cleanup(effect);
            context.push(effect);
            fn();
            context.pop();
        },
        dependencies: new Set()
    }

    effect.execute()
}
```

Now, "`count2 2`" is only logged once. What happened above can be briefly summarized as the following set of steps:

- "`createEffect`" first execution makes the effect and the signals, "`count`" and "`show`", linked in both ways, because of the calls, "`show()`" and "`count()`"
- "`setShow(false)`" cleans up the links above, but the calls, "`show()`" and "`count2()`", in the `fn` makes the effect now linked with "`count2`" and "`show`"
- when "`setCount(10)`" is executed, the effect is no longer linked to "`count`", and "[ ...subscriptions]" is empty, so nothing new is printed out

### Implement "`createMemo`" & "`untrack`"
"`createMemo`" is commonly used to create **derived signal** from signals created by "`createSignal`". Here we create a simplified version of "`createMemo`" of SolidJS. Notice how "`fn`", "`setSignal`", and "`createEffect`" are nested below:

```javascript 
function createMemo(fn){
  const [signal, setSignal] = createSignal();
  createEffect(()=>setSignal(fn()));
  return signal;
}

setCount(0);
setCount2(2);
// derived signal "sum" is based on "count" and "count2"
const sum = createMemo(()=>count()+count2());

// assuming you're using count and count2 from the previous lisings 
createEffect(()=>console.log(count(),count2(),sum()));
// print: 0,2,2

setCount(10)
//print two lines
// 10 2 12 
// 10 2 12 
// what happened under the hood:
// `subscriptions` in `setCount` has two members:
// the effect in `createMemo`, and the one at the end
// execute of the first `createEffect` calls `setSignal(fn())` with `fn()->12`
// because `signal` created by `createMemo` subscribes one effect(the one at the end)
// `observer.execute()` in the function `setSignal(fn())` results in the first
// "10 2 12" printed out
// coming back to the for loop in `setCount`, we are now iterating at the effect
// at the bottom. `observer.execute()` now results in the second "10 2 12" printed
```
