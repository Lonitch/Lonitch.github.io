<p>The plan for the prequel of qubit has been shelved for a long time, and for a while, there was uncertainty about what to write in the next installment. Upon closer examination, the reason lies in the author’s constant daydreaming that they could emulate the way Feynman, several decades ago, seamlessly bridged the logical chain from arithmetic to calculus using just four pages. Could one achieve a similar feat of bridging the logical chain from linear algebra to quantum mechanics in just four pages? At least for now, I cannot. Until I’m capable enough, please allow me to write something of academic value.</p>

          <div><p>If you wander in the world of quantum computing(QC) long enough, it becomes painful to follow the arguments of quantum algorithms with your vague and shaky knowledge base of linear algebra. Inspired by this, the author takes an initiative to write a series of notes on linear algebra before we undertake the endeavor of QC rigorously. By writing the notes with QC in mind, the author hopes to emphasize the key parts of linear algebra that will repeatedly be used in QC applications.</p>

Well, somehow my passion for “accessible” part of physics sustained and I decided to make notes for all the labs that I tought throughout last 3 years as a lab TA. The finalized manuscript is attached below. The source Latex code is also available on github <a href="https://github.com/Lonitch/HeatTransferLabNote">here</a>. For those who want to learn some heat transfer from a different perspective, I hope you find this volume a joyful read.</p>

<p>Been a while since my last post. A new semester has begun for about 4 weeks now, and my job as teaching assistant to a heat transfer class has to continue despite of the rampage of COVID. My research does not even remotely relate to heat transfer, but here I am, decide to summarize basics of heat conduction using inductive logics. By doing so I may not forget to mention important things during incoming classes. Hopefully, Delivering the content inductively can make the students feel that we are building a tunnel together from nowhere to a place where things can be understood in terms of temperature gradient, Fourier’s law, and heat flux.</p>

<p>Just passed my prelim exam. A monumental moment for a Ph.D. student to be officially called as “Ph.D. candidate”. The exam was not as smooth as I expected as I did pretty bad during the Q&amp;A section. The questions I got were not unreasonable but from perspectives that I was less prepared for. So there I was, felt abushed while tried my best to answer the questions using my fractured thoughts and vague memories. Apparently my committee was not pleased by my responses. At the end the chair of my committee had to jump into the conversations to prompt me so that some of my answers did not totally go off the lead. This is the first time I feel frustrated after passing an exam, a brand new experience for a Chinese kid, whose entire education experience has embedded an exam machinery into his head. It’s hard for me not to think that I was mistrusted by my advisor, and misunderstood by my committee, and my Ph.D. research is sort of a joke. But I HAVE TO STOP OVERTHINKING! And this blog is a way to keep my mind occupied.</p>

<p>The harmonic lattice is a topic on my writing plan for quite some time. The Harmonic lattice approximation gives the birth of phonon, the starting point of the second quantization. Unlike my previous blogs, this one only shows some handwriting notes that I made during the past two days. For me, preparing these notes is a joyful journey. I discover new things that advance my understanding of the field theory and old things that I took for granted. Also, to my best knowledge, there is no fool-proof introduction to harmonic lattice dynamics in the context of quantum field theory. Physicists tend to make things over-complicated while skipping details crucial for understanding. Chemists give their full trust to physicists and borrow the derived formulae from solid-state textbooks directly. As an amateur physicist and half-chemist, I went through all the troubles to derive equations that finally lead to quantum field operators step by step. I believe I found a way to explain best the quantization of the harmonic lattice based on introductory quantum mechanics. The ending shows the most relevant results of the quantum field theory of phonons that provide creative tools for studying the condensed matter. A big reason for me to show handwriting this time is those bulky equations in my notes. I wish I can have more time to make new blogs like this because this old-school style challenges my resilience, both emotionally and intellectually. But new things have to wait until I finish my prelim exam.</p>

<p>The youtuber 3Blue1Brown led me to Prof. Mark Levi’s <em>Mathematical Mechanics</em>, a collection of math problems solved by using mechanical intuitions. It is an eye-opening work, because I could never imagine that physics could be a perfect sevant for mathematics before. Solving problems using physics enpowers us to understand well-known theorems in an intuitive way, and the physical instinct embedded in the understanding really sheds lights in the ways of using the theorems efficiently. I will give my solutions to the exercise problems in the book here by transforming them into simple physical systems. Do not worry about too much <em>Solving Hamiltonian</em> in this blog, it is written in a more casual style comparing to my previous blog series, with the joy of problem solving being the primary focus.</p>

<p>While working on my side project of <em>ab initio</em> polaron theory, I realize that none of my notes is explicitly related to the radiation-matter interaction (RMI). It’s a bit weird at this point that RMI never occur to me as an important thing to learn even though the polaron is a result of interactions between electrons and radiation-excited phonons in crystalline lattice. After a search for proper sources to learn RMI, I laid my eyes on Edward Harris’ <strong>A Pedestrian Approach to Quantum Field Theory</strong>. For a guy who just finished Dr. Klauber’s excellent <strong>Student Friendly Quantum Field Theory</strong>, I was kinda reluctant to start reading another introductory book on QFT with concerns of wasting too much time. But Edward’s book turned out to be a huge page-turner after I scanned through the first chapter. This blog is dedicated to reproduce some of the important conclusions in the first chapter of Edward’s book. All the derivation in this blog is prepared for those who had an introductory non-relativistic quantum mechanics class, but a brief review of axioms of QM is also given somewhere along the derivation.</p>

<p>The polaron theory will be an important part of my final thesis work. I’m writing this to make sure I own every piece of my research proposal that I need to submit to my prelim committee. The blog is divided into three parts. In the first part I will explain the idea of polaron using Landau’s very first phenomenological theory. The second part develops a simple model to calculate the effective mass and size of the polaron. The results from Landau’s theory will be further developed in the last part to derive a quantized Hamiltonian (i.e. Frohlich’s Hamiltonian).</p>

<p>For a non-physicist, the energy band theory for solid materials could get nasty and hard to internalize. But band theory is like a basic languege everybody is fluent with in the community of solit state material research. Therefore, for people like me who is doing research or simply want to learn more advanced physics, we have to grasp the essences of band theory. To my best knowledge there is no textbook of solid-state materials that is designed for pedestrians. Thus, I am making this blog to summarize basic principles that could be of some use for chemists and beginners to research of materials science. This blog is definitely not mathematically vigorous but will performs as a reminder of important stuff about band theory that people could pick it up and read whenever they are lost in the analyses of energy bands. So still basic stuff, no pressure is on.</p>

<p>In preliminary quantum mechanics, we talked about several important postulates that carved into the monument of early quantum mechanics, which include Schrodinger equation, energy level quantization, etc. These postulates underspin what we now call the “First quantization”. After the introduction of the occupation number representation and borrowing the concept of fields from classical mechanics, people started to realize that the basic building unit of our universe is quantum fields which spread out to every corner of the universe. As a consequence physicists reformed the early formulation of QM to make it compatible with the special relativity, and that is the beginning of quantum field theory (QFT). The reformulation is called “second quantization”, and is an essential tool for solving many-body problems. In this blog we will review the basics of first and second quantization by following the three steps: (1) applying Dirac notation to QM formulation, (2) deriving the commutation rules of the creation and annihilation operators, and (3) introducing operators in QFT and their transformations. After this blog we are good to review the tight-binding theory.</p>

<p>I’ve been reading stuff for quite some time, now it’s the time to dive into some real-world problems. One of my current research interests is the many-body effects to conductivity properties of electroactive materials, like the electrode materials used in rechargeable battery and Faradaic desalination cell. More specifically, recent studies proved that the dynamics of polarons, quasi-particles made of a bare electron dressed by its interactions with positive charges and phonons, could be used to explain variation of electronic conductivity in various materials<a href="#1">[1]</a>. To study many-body effects in periodic potential environment (i.e., crystal lattice), I will prepare blog articles to refresh and develop a solid understanding of condensed state physics first, then review related concepts/methods from quantum field theory (QFT), and finally hit the details of polaron dynamics. This article is the first step of my possibly long journey to fully understand the polarons.</p>

          <div><p>I spend last two days reading Jakob Schwichtenberg’s <em>Teach Yourself Physics</em>, in which Jacob introduced multiple inspiring books of scientific philosophy.  Philosophy has not been a part of my life since my high school where Chinese students are required to remember philosophical quotes of Confusius and Laozi. Over the last decade, philosophical concepts like Yin and Yang are just fancy words that I use whenever I need to show people I know stuff. As a research assistant it is so easy for me to draw an equivalence sign between philosophy and subjective perspectives. Since my work is to provide objective views of how electrode materials evolve during physio-chemical processes, I used to believe that there is no need to learn things from people who spend their whole life in isolation and write out their hard-to-fanthom thoughts.</p>
