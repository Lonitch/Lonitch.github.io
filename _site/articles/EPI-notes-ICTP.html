      <h1>Seminar Notes on Electron-Phonon Interaction</h1>
<p class="subtitle">October 20, 2020</p>

<h2 id="link-to-my-notes">Link to my notes</h2>
<p>The handwriting notes are based on a seminar series on the topic of electron-phonon interaction (EPI) from first principle, hosted at ICTP, Italy, 2018. You can download it by using the link <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nDtVoIOdJ6E3Ar0jskQhkcvHemC8yCqv/view?usp=sharing">here</a>. These notes might be some preliminaries for my next paper.<!--more--></p>

<h2 id="updates-on-my-life">Updates on my life</h2>

<p>It’s been a while without much done either for my Ph.D. or for my life. First thing worth mentioning is that I finished my first draft on my DFT+ML method for investigating correlations between different polyatomic arrangements in a hydrated lattice. The comments got from my advisor are not harsh but some were bit dissmissive from a perspective of the author, as the author tried to explain the math in the manuscript for one whole week while slep 4 hours a day. The puzzling emotion in the comments is expected as ML has nothing to do with my advisor’s previous training, but I still believe I found something unique, and cannot be revealed easily using DFT calculations or experiments. I guess my current paper showed, for the first time to the eyes of chemical physcists, that ML model is not just a black-box predictor, but an inspirational equippment for researchers to explore energy landscapes of complicated atomic systems. This sounds like bragging, but hey, academic work needs advocating too~</p>

<p>Second, I was turned down by a girl, a clever and pretty girl that I’m no longer so sure that I’m worthy to her. Without any sign of kinship in my rearview, the rejection left me at a crossroads with three branches laying out for me to choose. The first one is chaotic, with neon lights shinning ahead. It’s a path towards a solid job either as a researcher, or as a professional in a company. The second one is foggy and tortuous, and all I can see is a candle light dancing in a tiny house along the path. Everything growing along the second path is bleak, but I cannot take my eyes off the candle whenever I turn my face towards it. The candle is my vanishing yet long-lasting childish ambition: study somthing truly meaningful to me in the realm of mathematical physics. The last path is built on a cliff, leading to a mountaintop where a small group of entrepreneurs are celebrating their success and laughing at the victums of the dangerous cliff. So far, I’m biased towards the second path, as I really, I mean really, want to find a corner in this world, light a candle, do my own studies without worrying anything but doing my math right. In a sense, I wanna become a math monk like Grothendieck but much dumber than him. You may find this idea weird but after some reflections of my life, I feel no urge to find a job or get to know a girl. I am approaching to a point of being a intelligent male rat in the No.25 universe, the rats that only mind their own businesses. Please save your empathy if you think the rejection was a traumatized experience. It actually wasn’t, and I have experienced something much worse than that. Like I said, she is quite clever and knows how to deal with propositions from guys. Instead, it’s a trigger that cuts off a sensitive variable in the function called my life. After the rejection, I somehow became more focused on thinking how I think for the last three years. A subset of the questions I’ve been wondering contains: how did I end up with those choices? Why did I get obssessed/lose interests in somthing? What are the components of my life that I need serious philosophy to fit in? How should I judge if my emotion is toxic or not? I don’t have all of them sorted out yet. If I do, I might start to write a book about my answers, possibly in Chinese, with a name of “Principles and techniques for surviving Ph.D.”. The performance of my book on the market might eventually drive me to the third path. Ah-ha, I just find a fiber bundle structure between the second and the third path！</p>

<p>Last but not the least, I get to know a very smart and interesting physicist who believes that the world is essentially classic and dislikes Einstein’s relativity much more than I do.</p>
